### When does an OBD become active or official? Is there a threshold or does the outcome community decide a timeline?

OBD participation will vary greatly based on geography and topic. As a result, it doesn’t make sense to apply a one-size-fits-all approach to thresholding. OBDs should be able to accept proposals and input from experts and politicians as soon as they are listed on the platform. That said, it’s likely that OBDs will receive more engagement from politicians and experts as constituent participation increases. The OBD will then become active or official after the donors vote on which proposal to use and send funds to escrow. To recap, an OBD becomes official once donors have had a chance to hold a vote on the proposals and leave if they are unsatisfied with the results.  Note - any donor who voted for an option that does not win, will have the ability to withdraw their donation during a grace period between the vote and the funds moving to escrow.

### How and when are politicians and experts notified? How will they be attracted to the platform?

As Govrn becomes a mainstream platform, we anticipate that experts and politicians will be engaging of their own accord because there is a value-add for each stakeholder group.  For politicians, Govrn offers a new campaign finance stream where they can get paid to actually just do their job: work for constituents.  For experts, Govrn offers an easy way to influence government decision-making and policy without sacrificing the ability to do research.  To streamline the OBD discovery process, experts and politicians can create Govrn accounts that will prompt them if OBDs arise that are relevant to them.  Constituents can also collectively decide to notify politicians and experts to request proposals.  These become design decisions and are currently in the process of being built. 

### Can constituents change their donation status after hearing from politicians (and experts)? 

Yes. There are a few key windows in the OBD process that happen before pledges become official and enter escrow (a technical way of saying the donation status can no longer change). First, the OBD is open for expert proposals.  During this window, experts and politicians will submit proposals (and support arguments) to constituents.  Then, constituents vote on which proposal they like best.  Anyone who voted for a proposal which lost the vote can claim back their pledge.  The proposal is then matched with the relevant politicians.  Again, anyone who is not in favor of these politicians can change their donation status to retract their pledge.  At this point, the metric and the politician have been identified and constituents have one last chance to retract their donation status.  

### Why are metrics and politicians determined after donations are sent?

Constituents can still donate to an OBD after the metric and politician have been set, but constituents who donate to an issue beforehand have the option to be more involved in the deliberation process of flagging issues they care about and voting on metrics. 

### If the metric isn’t reached, should donors get their pledge back rather than sending it to a political opponent or nonprofit?

If the agreed upon metric is not reached, constituents have several options for where to send their pledged amount of money:
To a political opponent’s campaign of their choice
To a nonprofit of their choice in the space
To the original politician’s campaign (maybe they made good progress or extenuating circumstances got in the way)

The reason we’re not in favor of allowing constituents to “get their pledge back” is that it creates a reverse incentive.  Constituents would now have a reason to **not** want the outcome to be achieved as they’d receive their pledge back. (e.g. 1.9% instead of 2%)

### How are experts selected? Will they be internal or external to the Govrn platform and will they be credentialed / vetted?

Experts are external to the Govrn platform and must make an account with Govrn which will pass a basic vetting process. But ultimately, experts must make their case directly to constituents for why the metric they are proposing makes sense and why they are qualified to make that proposal.  Experts can also rank each others’ proposals so that time-strapped constituents can have an easy to determine which proposals are deemed as reputable by other experts.

### Will corporations and organizations legally considered individuals by campaign finance law be allowed to use the Govrn platform?

No. Corporations are not legally allowed to donate directly to political candidates, but have to use other mechanisms like PACs instead.  Govrn isn’t a PAC and doesn’t provide the infrastructure necessary for corporations to be legally compliant.
