## Welcome to the Govrn Compendium!

Technology is enabling fascinating ways of creating, sharing and preserving knowledge. At Govrn we are constantly learning about the future of governance, innovative citizen participation practices, novel open-source tools, lessons from other entrepreneurial ventures and more. Echoing our mission to create a movement and community driven by the shared interest to open up civic participation and social change, we have created the Govrn Compendium .

This compendium is a collection of information pertaining to entrepreneurship, tech, open source, design thinking, tech, politics, governance. This collection is built out of resources that our community has come across during formal research, nerdy deep dives, and serendipitous internet finds. Our goal is to make this an organic and self-maintaining space to bring forward the resources, tools, and ideas that are shaping our movement and the future of **open source politics**.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [How to Manage for Collective Creativity](https://www.ted.com/talks/linda_hill_how_to_manage_for_collective_creativity?language=en) | `Collective Intelligence` & `Innovation` | `Talk` | Linda Hill | 2014 | What's the secret to unlocking the creativity hidden inside your daily work, and giving every great idea a chance? Harvard professor Linda Hill, co-author of "Collective Genius," has studied some of the world's most creative companies to come up with a set of tools and tactics to keep great ideas flowing -- from everyone in the company, not just the designated "creatives." |
| [vTaiwan: Using Digital Technology to Write Digital Laws](https://congress.crowd.law/case-vtaiwan.html) | `Collective Intelligence` `Digitalization` `Governance` `Open Government` `Open Source` & `Policy` | `Case Study` | NYU GovLab | 2020 | vTaiwan is a four-stage online and offline process for moving from issue to legislative enactment while building consensus among diverse stakeholders. It has been used to craft 26 pieces of legislation relating to the digital economy collaboratively between the government and the public. vTaiwan relies on a series of existing open source tools (meaning they can be freely modified and customized, as needed). The process begins with a member of the public proposing an issue and a relevant government agency agreeing to steward and participate in the process. Since 2017, each Ministry is obliged to appoint a Participation Officer responsible for engaging in the process. |

|[Handbook of Transnational Governance: Institutions and Innovations](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Handbook+of+Transnational+Governance:+Institutions+and+Innovations-p-9780745650616)|`Governance`|`Book`|Thomas Hale & David Held|2011|"When we speak of global governance today, we no longer mean simply state-to-state diplomacy, international treaties, or intergovernmental organizations like the United Nations. Alongside these ‘traditional' elements of global politics are a host of new institutions ranging from global networks of governmental officials, to private codes of conduct for corporations, to action-oriented partnerships of NGOs, governments, corporations, and other actors. These innovative mechanisms offer intriguing solutions to pressing transnational challenges as diverse as climate change, financial governance, workers' rights, and public health. But they also raise new questions about the effectiveness and legitimacy of transnational governance."|
| [Solving Public Problems](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300230154/solving-public-problems) |  `Governance` `Open Government`| `Book` | Beth Noveck | 2021 | "The challenges societies face today, from inequality to climate change to systemic racism, cannot be solved with yesterday’s toolkit. Solving Public Problems shows how readers can take advantage of digital technology, data, and the collective wisdom of our communities to design and deliver powerful solutions to contemporary problems. Offering a radical rethinking of the role of the public servant and the skills of the public workforce, this book is about the vast gap between failing public institutions and the huge number of public entrepreneurs doing extraordinary things—and how to close that gap." |

She examines GitHub as a platform; the structures, roles, incentives, and relationships of open source projects; and their heretofore unexplored maintenance, via the work that software requires of its creators and the costs of production that must be maintained. Open source offers us a model through which to understand the challenges faced by online creators on all platforms." |
