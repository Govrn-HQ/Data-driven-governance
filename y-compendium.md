## Welcome to the Govrn Compendium!

Technology is enabling fascinating ways of creating, sharing and preserving knowledge. At Govrn we are constantly learning about the future of governance, innovative citizen participation practices, novel open-source tools, lessons from other entrepreneurial ventures and more. Echoing our mission to create a movement and community driven by the shared interest to open up civic participation and social change, we have created the Govrn Compendium .

This compendium is a collection of information pertaining to entrepreneurship, tech, open source, design thinking, tech, politics, governance. This collection is built out of resources that our community has come across during formal research, nerdy deep dives, and serendipitous internet finds. Our goal is to make this an organic and self-maintaining space to bring forward the resources, tools, and ideas that are shaping our movement and the future of **open source politics**.

Make the most out of the compendium following these guidelines:
