## Govrn open source white paper

### Welcome!

We’re happy you’re here! At Govrn we think the best ideas come from the community and thrive in the open, so we’re writing our white paper in public. See details about the process here.

📖 Readable

We'll look at merge requests as frequently as possible.  If for some reason we're not able to merge your PR, we will archive them to include in our community readouts and reach out to you.

🏗 Constructive

We want to know not only what you agree or disagree with but why. Was there a similar case study or research conducted? What could be reframed, and how?  What other sources should we look into?  Have a better way to phrase an idea? Submit a PR and go for it!! 

🤝 Collaborative

This is a community effort, so please feel free to respond to each other’s comments in the issues tab.

🙈 Fun

We host community calls and live editing sessions during each white paper section. Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/td5akZ7DMX) for more info.

👋 Welcoming

We do not tolerate bigotry (sexism, racism, homophobia, etc.) and if such comments surface, we will delete them as soon as we become aware of them and restrict that account.
