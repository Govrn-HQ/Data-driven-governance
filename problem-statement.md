# Introduction

The following are the major problems we see plaguing the U.S. Political, Government, and Civic systems.  While this list is certainly not exhaustive, it contains the ones we believe the Govrn Model can help alleviate.

At the heart of the issue is declining trust in government. Currently, only [17% of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/04/11/public-trust-in-government-1958-2019/) today say they can trust the government in Washington to do what is right “just about always” (3%) or “most of the time” (14%).  This is compounded by the fact that [63% of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/) believe that trust in government makes it easier to solve problems.

Trust in government is a core tenant of a functioning democracy.  This becomes even more true in a representative democracy, where we elect leaders to make decisions on our behalf, with only a two, four, or six year feedback cycle (i.e. voting).  How can we expect the system to be fixed if we don’t trust those with the power to fix it?  We need to fix trust first to even have the correct actors in place to fix the system. 

Further, our system is designed to mainly offer political solutions (if you don’t like the Dems, vote for Republicans).  Again, unfortunately, trust has gone down with both Democrat and Republican administrations, showing us that depending on “political partisan solutions” as our core mechanism isn’t an effective fix to the problem.  Modern political parties have shown they are better designed to provide political alternatives to the “other side of the spectrum” rather than changing the underlying structure. 

While the most immediate use case of Govrn is to increase campaign finance equitability, we believe this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Addressing campaign finance can create second order impacts to create a better constituent-politician feedback loop and give constituents more influence on individual issues within the political party structure.  We address the problems we currently see in these spaces in the “Voting as an insufficient form of feedback” and “Limitations of Current Political Party System'' sections.

As you read through this, please note: **this section is the first of many sections.**  Here we define the parameters of our problem statement. In future sections, we’ll dive into more details regarding how the Govrn model can alleviate each problem. 

# Voting as an Insufficient Form of Feedback

At Govrn we love voting, but we also recognize that it is an insufficient form of feedback to our politicians.  Not only does it only happen once every two, four, or six years, but we are also limited to strictly voting yes or no on the candidate that most closely aligns with our ideology across a multitude of issues. (This is especially difficult for large primary races within the same political party.)

Additionally, voting doesn’t provide a way to show which specific issues are the most important to us, nor does it provide a mechanism of continuous influence on prioritization or involvement in the implementation of the outcomes we care about once the candidate reaches office. Many times we are at a loss of ways to influence, especially if we want to do so outside of elections.

Further, because voting is a sporadic form of feedback, elections have taken on incredible importance.  Oftentimes, constituents feel as if they only have to “pay attention to politics'' once every few years.  As a result, similarly, the political community tends to hyperfocus on constituents only prior to elections rather than consistently during a politician's duration in office.  By having only one form of widespread and structured feedback, we have created a single point of failure and hyper importance on elections.

# Problems with Campaign Finance

## Misaligned Incentives for Politicians

Next, the campaign finance incentives we have built for politicians are not designed to effectively work for constituents, but rather focus on getting politicians re-elected.  This concept is based on the idea that elections will always produce responsive government.  In essence, politicians will get re-elected if they work for constituents, and won’t be re-elected if they don’t.  While this does make sense from a systems perspective, how it manifests is un-ideal.  Generally, at least [~80% of the time, the candidate that spends more money wins re-election](https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/winning-vs-spending?cycle=2020). 

Granted, while we recognize that this only proves correlation and not causation, if you were a politician and saw these numbers, it would give you pause.  And unfortunately, this is exactly how it plays out in politics.  In 2017 it was reported that the DNC recommended that representatives spend [40-45% of a daily schedule](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/call-time-congressional-fundraising_n_2427291) on fundraising.

Further, it’s commonly reported that [fundraising for the next election season begins as soon as the last one ends](https://www.opensecrets.org/resources/dollarocracy/07.php).  And if only further proof of the incentive, politicians participate in this even though they publicly state their [displeasure with the system](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/call-time-congressional-fundraising_n_2427291).  The incentive to spend time raising money rather than working for constituents is so strong that politicians participate in the process despite comparing it to “putting bamboo shoots under their fingernails.”

## Opaqueness of Current Campaign Finance System

While PACs and 501c4s have masterfully leveraged campaign finance systems in their favor, ordinary constituents are limited in the tools and methods we can use to leverage the same campaign finance systems.  For most constituents, the only option is donating directly to a politician.  Further, there is no way for you to identify the reason you are donating to a politician or receive feedback that your voice was heard or acted upon.  Current campaign finance acts as a black box.  You donate, it goes into a politician’s war chest to be spent, and you never know how or what it was used for. Ordinary constituents are limited in the tools we have to leverage the same campaign finance systems that the elite have capitalized on.

We do want to note that the above does not even touch on Dark Money, which can provide an invisible source of funding to candidates, with no clear traceability of whom is supporting what.  This is a topic we won’t address in this current white paper, but plan on writing about in more detail in the future.

## Market Inefficiencies with Campaign Finance

On top of all this, there is a huge inefficiency in how we donate money to candidates in order for issues to simply be heard.  Many times, candidates become involved in a political race for no other reason than to bring a particular issue into the mainstream or move the political conversation further to the left or right.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent and donated to candidates who know they will lose, just so they can have an issue heard.  Not only does this create the unfortunate consequence of forcing the frontrunner to raise more money but many times the issue that the losing candidate ran on never makes it past the debate!

At Govrn, we’ve been referring to this as Political Deadweight Loss.  [Deadweight loss is the economic concept of money lost due to market inefficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss).  Donating to candidates who will lose only for an issue to be heard, instead of donating to the issue itself is a version of this type of loss.  A similar argument could be made for money pouring into races that have disproportionate political significance, such as the U.S. 2020 Senate runoffs in Georgia.  The country’s response to the race was completely rational, but that only further highlights the point.  Georgia became the key to the election, which encouraged more than [$443 million](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/01/money-spent-georgia-senate-runoffs/617545/) to be spent in just that race.

# Limitations of Current Political Party System

## Two-party System as a Duopoly

Unfortunately, the two-party system is so rigid that it has created a duopoly that gives Americans fewer choices instead of more. Not only is it difficult for third parties to gain political power, but it’s also difficult for non establishment candidates to gain political power within their own party. 

## Hyper Dependence on Political Parties to Champion Issues

Furthermore, having only two parties to choose from limits your ability to define your own politics.  Even if you only have a couple issues you strongly care about, as you only get the option of voting for a politician instead of an issue, you are forced to vote for the politician’s entire party platform as well as their position within the party.  This creates a world where championing an issue typically means championing a political party as a whole, which can have a polarizing effect. 

This runs counter to what Americans want, as can be seen by the fact that a [higher plurality of registered voters now identify as “Independent” rather than “Democrat” or “Republican”](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/09/13/1-the-changing-composition-of-the-political-parties/0_2-2/).  This difference becomes even more pronounced with regards to [Millenials and GenXers](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/09/13/2-party-affiliation-among-voters-1992-2016/2_7-2/).  Unfortunately, constituents are then left with limited avenues to champion issues if not approved by a major party.  Further, even if an issue does enter the purview of a political party, it still then requires approval from party establishment leadership.
