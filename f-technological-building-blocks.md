## Existing Research and Innovations

## Introduction: What are the building blocks of open source governance?
At Govrn, we view outcome-based donations (OBDs) as an idea that combines innovations and research that already exist in unique ways.  We’re bridging connections between related ideas to create something new.  Read more about Govrn and OBDs [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y3Kq08ckOFa4N5nDx-bOZKi_jdouFSTiRjgvOaJl5zM/edit).

Our work exists in the broader context of a governance renaissance.  So many people and organizations are rethinking the roles of institutions, governance, and civic engagement to create more equitable, transparent, and participatory systems better able to address complex problems.

There’s no way we can cover all of what is going on in the space.  But we do want to highlight some amazing work by others to both set the context for the broader idea of governance innovation and to explain where some of the ideas for Govrn come from.

So far we’ve written about [collective intelligence](url) and [evidence-based policymaking & data-driven governance](url) and how these frameworks contribute to open governance.

Here, we’ll dive into the key technological building blocks of open source governance and how OBDs relate.


## Technological Building Blocks

### Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) present one of the most interesting opportunities on how to update politics and governance.  First, a technical definition: [A DAO is a group organized around a mission that coordinates through a shared set of rules enforced on a blockchain](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o).

In simple terms, it allows for any number of individuals to coordinate and work together without needing a centralized or institutions body.  It allows for individuals who believe in a similar idea or outcome, to work together transparently and independently, without having to be beholden to structures that might have come about previously.  

Additionally, since the rules of participation are enforced by the platform (the blockchain), they are able to operate in a trustless manner.  A trustless manner means that since all the rules are programmatically enforced, you don’t have to “trust” that the other person will be a “good actor”.  To even participate in the DAO, they are forced to be a good actor.  This is important because it creates a way for people who have never met who might live completely different lives to actually trust each other and work together.  The trustless state creates a web of trust that didn’t used to exist.

Why does all this mean?  It means we’re able to define our own politics.  It means that by using the infrastructure a DAO provides, anyone is able to create their own coalitions, their own committees, even their own political parties and PACs.  DAOs provide the benefits that a political party provides, without the baggage of political parties.  

By leveraging DAOs, we’re removing the barriers that have existed for people to become involved in politics or civically engaged.  It allows anyone who is able to create a movement of support to chart their own path into politics without having to compromise.  

What we hope is that it won’t even feel like you’re using a DAO.  It’s just going to feel like how politics should feel.
 
### Distributed Version Control

In addition to DAOs, distributed version control is another innovation that fits into the open governance puzzle.  [Git](https://www.nobledesktop.com/blog/what-is-git-and-why-should-you-use-it) is a distributed version control system that tracks file history among collaborators and is most commonly used for software code.  It allows collaborators to create individual versions of the main file, make updates, and merge changes back into the main file simultaneously.  Thus git enables automated record keeping of the file based on individually uploaded and downloaded changes.  Version control is a gamechanger for projects with a large number of contributors, and especially those organized in a networked rather than hierarchical structure. 

One of the most common version control platforms is [GitHub](https://github.com/), which now has [40 million users and is used by over 2 million organizations](https://hackernoon.com/githubs-top-100-most-valuable-repositories-out-of-96-million-bb48caa9eb0b) worldwide.  And while GitHub is mostly used for code, the public sector has written about GitHub’s potential impact beyond code: in [law](https://www.datacoalition.org/version-control-for-law-tracking-changes-in-the-u-s-congress/), [policy](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/01/15/the-github-difference-overcoming-barriers-to-collaboration-in-government/), and document writing generally.

The Brookings Institute writes that [“GitHub is not just the dominant code-hosting platform on the Internet.  Its underlying architecture also represents a new approach to collaboration that could have profound effects on our governing institutions and governance settings.”](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/01/15/the-github-difference-overcoming-barriers-to-collaboration-in-government/)  Here’s what they said about why:

1. The structure of GitHub promotes co-creation and repurposing of knowledge.  

Contributors aren’t just leaving edits on the main document (“repository”), they’re actually making a traceable copy of the original (“forking the repository”) where they are at liberty to create new knowledge.  This new knowledge may be merged back into the original per the discretion of the original document owner (via a “pull request”), or it can take on a life of its own.  

2. GitHub provides transparency and accountability on contributions.

GitHub traces each individual’s contribution to a document over time.  It also automatically traces the pathway that documents take via forking, so if a new document is created based on an older document, that history will be visible.  (These features are especially impactful for tracing contributions, ownership, and changes in [legislative documents](https://www.datacoalition.org/version-control-for-law-tracking-changes-in-the-u-s-congress/).) 

These factors support open governance, defined by the authors as “interaction amongst citizens, and between citizens and governing institutions.”  And GitHub can play a key role in opening governance because of “the promise of governments as non-hierarchical knowledge organizations, maximizing the potential contribution that all public servants can make.”  

At Govrn, we see version control as not only a tool for public servants internal to government, but any citizen who wants to contribute to policy, legislation, and publicly relevant decision making.  Imagine policy drafts and campaign platforms happening collaboratively on GitHub.  Imagine the public being able to track which specific parts of proposed legislation came from each congressional member. 

### Blockchain in Government

Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, is another innovation with great potential to transform governance.  Proponents of the technology write that blockchain [can promote transparency and efficiency of government services while reducing corruption](https://www.ijimai.org/journal/sites/default/files/2020-08/ijimai_6_3_8.pdf).  NYU’s GovLab categorizes blockchain applications for governance into three categories: identity, tracking and tracing, and smart contracts.  They provide an excellent [resource page](https://blog.thegovlab.org/post/the-govlab-selected-readings-on-blockchain-technology-and-its-potential-for-transforming-governance), list of [case studies](https://blockchan.ge/#), and [analysis](https://blog.thegovlab.org/post/if-when-and-how-blockchain-technologies-can-provide-civic-change) for how blockchain can help address public problems and solve information asymmetries.  

The most relevant application to Govrn’s OBD model is the smart contract piece, so we’ll dive into that in a bit more detail.  A smart contract is an automatic and autonomous escrow agreement enabled by blockchain.  This means that the agreement can self-execute once predefined conditions are met, instead of relying on a third party agent or institution for implementation.  In the context of governance, smart contracts are relevant to public administration, especially public procurement.  (The [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/) estimates that 15% of public procurement funds are wasted due to corruption and with 30-50% of countries’ total spending going toward public procurement, that’s a big deal. Case studies and more details [here](https://www.ijimai.org/journal/sites/default/files/2020-08/ijimai_6_3_8.pdf).)  Similarly, Govrn’s OBD model is using smart contracts to tackle inefficiencies in campaign finance.  

## Open Source Governance

DAOs, distributed version control, and blockchain aren’t just shiny gadgets: they represent innovations in the social structure of governance and decision-making.  Along with collective intelligence/ smart crowdsourcing, evidence-based policymaking, and data-driven governance, these are the key building blocks for opening governance.  
 
There is no single definition for open governance, but it’s generally referred to as a more transparent, participatory, and collaborative form of governance that increases legitimacy, effectiveness, and diverse citizen involvement.  It means the government is working with people and “creating meaningful pathways for citizens to contribute.”  It’s the difference between a “passive, read-only society” and a “writable society, where we have the power to change our communities, institutions… and put ourselves on the pathway towards this open government revolution” ([Beth Noveck, Demand a More Open-Source Government](https://ted2srt.org/talks/beth_noveck_demand_a_more_open_source_government)).

The idea of making governance “writable” is what we’re working towards at Govrn, starting with OBDs.  OBDs enable citizens to collaborate with elected officials to meet community goals.  At a technical level, each OBD is a DAO that establishes a smart contract to transfer campaign finance donations to the elected official only if and when the community goal is reached.  What this means in practice is that citizens have more creative ownership over campaign platform creation and public goods goals.  They move from simply giving feedback to co-creating governance objectives.  The government still remains the moderator and implementer, but ownership moves towards citizens.
